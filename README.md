# MICRO-STRIP-PATCH-ANTENNA
Wireless technology is one of the main areas of research in the world of  communication systems today and a study of communication systems is incomplete  without an understanding of the operation and fabrication of antennas. The main aim of this  work is to design, develop and test the Microstrip Patch antenna.This study also  emphasizes on simulation of micro-strip patch antenna using HFSS software &amp; study  the radiation pattern &amp; radiation pattern parameters and comparison with specifications/requirements. Inset feed technique was adopted. This work is also  focused on characterization of fabricated antenna in view of parameters like VSWR,  Antenna efficiency, Axial ratio, Gain and radiation pattern.
